    <h1 style="background-color: blue; color: white; text-align: center; padding: 1em;">Hindi Day</h1>
    <div style="padding-bottom: 0px;">
        <div style="text-align: justify;">We celebrate 14th September as Hindi day every year. As we are leading towards
            modern culture, we are adopting English in our culture, that is right but we are giving less significance to the
            Hindi language that is not right. In bureaucracy also, Hindi has lost its old value as the old government agents
            are bring replaced by new agents. We can see that ten years ago when we get any letter from the officials, it
            was typed in Hindi but today the letter id typed in English even the rural people don't know to read them. So we
            can see that English is on its way to replace Hindi from all areas.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">The English language is not only affecting day to day life but the literature
            also. English literature is being more and more popular day by day as Hindi literature, being more descriptive
            and intuitive, is left behind. As English is spoken in half of the world and Hindi is an only Indian language,
            English literature is richer than Hindi literature. The number of writers in English is significantly more than
            the number of writers in Hindi. But Hindi literature is more Advance than English literature. The decorations,
            poetic figures, metaphors are more advanced in Hindi literature. Chhayawad: is yet to come in English.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">But nowadays literature lovers are getting attracted more towards English
            literature than Hindi literature. We read not only Indian English writers but also many foreigners. Now if we
            ask any literature lover about his or her favorite book then it is surely an English book. So Hindi literature
            has lost its importance and popularity in the last twenty years mostly. The number of English readers had raised
            but the number of Hindi lovers had decreased.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">The reason behind it is the spreading of English medium schools and the tendency
            of their parents to teach them English. I have seen in these schools that they like to teach them English but
            they don't pay attention to the Hindi language. We were taught Hindi rhymes in the nursery but hey are being
            taught English poems. The children's Hindi become terrible they don't know even Hindi countings. I have a friend
            who says that he can't read Hindi because their board eliminated Hindi after eighth and now his Hindi is
            terrible so it is the total fault of our education system.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">That has a terrible and big effect on the writers' world. Because Hindi Literature
            is losing popularity, the existing Hindi writer also losing sales. For young writers like me, who write Hindi,
            they don't seem a bright career in writing so they don't want to take it. And the literature lovers, who can go
            into writing, they don't have good knowledge of Hindi. And because the demand for English literature is
            increasing, the publishers also focusing on English literature more than Hindi. We have produced a good number
            of English novelist and writer as Chetan Bhagat, Amish Tripathi, and many more names in the last two decades but
            not even one great Hindi writer.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">The solution to it is in the following steps.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><i>First</i></span> to make the literature
            lovers read Hindi literature. For this, we have to make them aware of the beauty of Hindi literature. We can
            recite a Hindi poem in front of them. We can suggest them to read some good and basics of Hindi poems, hence we
            can make them read Hindi.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><i>Second,</i></span> add new people to Hindi
            reading club. The people who don't read any literature also should tend to read Hindi books. This can be done by
            organizing the Open Mic, 'Hasya Kavi Sammelan'. Comedy is more popular in India, So hasyakavita can be a good
            tool to make new readers.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: georgia;"><i>Third,</i></span> making the writers write
            Hindi. This can be done by giving them titles and Prompts to write. Organizing Hindi poetry writing competitions
            and providing them the Audience. Here comes the importance of Hindi day.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">Hindi Day should be celebrated in vast enthusiasm. All three points should be
            covered in the celebration. We should organize open mics and other competitions also. We should make people
            aware of Hindi poets. We should invite them to recite their poetry. We should distribute our Hindi books free to
            the literature lovers so they can get to be love in Hindi too. We should spread Hindi literature as Hindi poems
            among people with the help of social media and other platforms. TV channels and public organizations, societies
            can help us more in this. We should publicize the Hindi Literature more and more. Just one day, Just Hindi day,
            Just 14th September.&nbsp;</div>
