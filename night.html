    <div style="padding-bottom: 0px;">
        <div style="text-align: justify;">Is it that simple to love someone, No! It is not so simple to love someone. When
            you love someone and you get her then it is a bit complicated but when you don't get her then it is really
            complicated.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">This is when we get the complex feelings. When you love her so deeply but you are
            unable to tell her how much you love her, when you don't tell her then something happens in your life that you
            don't want to happen. Someone else get her. And you left with your feelings only that has no value now, when
            your beloved didn't understand it. You slowly get drowned in the deep sea of emotions.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">When you see her with someone else, your heart get burnt inside but you try to
            show yourself happy from outside. You feel a kind of jealousy for the other guy. You avoid eye contact with her.
            When you talk to her by mistake your voice becomes moistured but hell, she didn't recognize.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">You want to cry but the emotions don't take the form of tears. You become sad for
            forever. You lost your smile. Then you want to be cut from the world. You miss the contact with your friends.
            You become straight-forward, only work and go home. You spent time alone the most. Scrolling the photos with
            your beloved and thinking about your badluck of not getting her.&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">You face anxiety, you want to sleep but you are unable to sleep. You close your
            eyes and her face comes to your mind. Her voice reecho in your brain. You find yourself lying in the bed,
            sleepless. you took out your phone and see her photos again. Just thinking yourself with her and your grief keep
            on increasing. You try to sleep but unable to sleep again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">Music is so close to our heart, it can change mood. Completely unable to sleep,
            you took out your earphones and start listing your favorite playlist. But in this case, it won't help. The
            lyrics of the songs, addressed to their beloved remind you of her. And you went through the memories when you
            explained your favorite song to her, it increases the pain.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">Then you accuse yourself, you abuse yourself. You think that all is your fault,
            you would have told her your feelings. Perhaps you take your phone; open whatsapp, and type I LOVE YOU to send
            her. But you can't gather the courage to send it. You delete it and the cycle of What IF starts. You want to go
            back into past and and tell her how much you love her. You want to cry, but you can't.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">You sit on the bed with off lights, you think about her, just think about her
            endlessly the whole night. The feeling that you lost her, still in your heart, giving the pain. Your mind replay
            every moment spent with her. Your mind recollects the dreams you have seen about her. Your mind tells you the
            feeling you have for her one by one. Your mind empty, only her feelings only her feelings. Now you cry, alone in
            he bed. None hears you, and it is morning now.&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">This is just a start of the long, sleepless, painful nights. With her memories and
            you alone. You know just one thing, that you love her, you love only her none else. Your heart is still attached
            to her. You can't love someone else, you love her, only her, only her, endlessly.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">To be continued....</div>
